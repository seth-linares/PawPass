# Overview

PawPass is designed for individuals seeking a secure, efficient, and free solution for managing their passwords. It uniquely combines the power of Rust and Tauri for the backend to ensure maximum security and performance, with a sleek and intuitive interface built using TypeScript and React for the frontend. This blend of technologies not only guarantees a high level of security for stored data but also ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.

The project was initiated as a personal challenge to create a viable alternative to existing password management solutions, specifically targeting students and individuals who might find the cost of premium password managers prohibitive. As a college student myself, I recognized the need for a tool that could offer robust password management capabilities without the associated costs. PawPass aims to fill this gap, providing users with the ability to generate strong, unique passwords, securely store them, and easily retrieve them as needed, all without any cost.

# Where to Install
Under the "Releases" tab, you can find the latest release of PawPass. There are 2 different installers: one which is a .exe file for Windows, and another which is a .msi file for Windows. While these are explicitly for Windows, the .msi file can be used on other operating systems with the use of a program such as Wine.



# Development Environment

PawPass was developed using a combination of Rust and Tauri for the backend, providing a robust and secure foundation for password management. The frontend was crafted with TypeScript and React, offering a modern and responsive user interface.

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React
- **Backend**: Rust, Tauri
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
